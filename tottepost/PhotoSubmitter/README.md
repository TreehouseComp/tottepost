PhotoSubmitter
===========================
The purpose of the PhotoSubmitter class library is to facilitate the development of photo upload application.

There are a lot of Social Network Services and Cloud Storage Services. And each services have their own SDK to connect to their service. Unfortunately SDKs are not compatible each other.ã€€Especially between Social Network Services and Cloud Storage Services is completely different. 

So, I developed PhotoSubmitter library as an abstraction layer for this situation.

The Code
------------------------------------------
PhotoSubmitter supports authentication like,

    [[PhotoSubmitterManager submitterForType:PhotoSubmitterTypeFacebook] login];

This code will brings up Safari or Facebook app in your iPhone for authentication. You can receive messages from PhotoSubmitter while authenticating with implementing `PhotoSubmitterAuthenticationDelegate`. 

There are a lot of supported services, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and so on. You can enable submitter with just calling login method.

    [[PhotoSubmitterManager submitterForType:PhotoSubmitterTypeDropbox] login];
    [[PhotoSubmitterManager submitterForType:PhotoSubmitterTypeEvernote] login];

Once PhotoSubmitter is enabled and authenticated, you can submit photo to the service like this,

    PhotoSubmitterImageEntity *photo = 
        [[PhotoSubmitterImageEntity alloc] initWithData:data];
    [PhotoSubmitterManager submitPhoto:photo];

This code is creating photo entity and submitting photo to the authenticated services asynchronously. You can receive messages from PhotoSubmitter while submitting photo with implementing `PhotoSubmitterPhotoDelegate`.
