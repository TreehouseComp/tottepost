PhotoSubmitter
===========================
The purpose of the PhotoSubmitter class library is to facilitate the development of photo upload application.

There are a lot of Social Network Services and Cloud Storage Services. And each services have their own SDK to connect to their service. Unfortunately SDKs are not compatible each other.ã€€Especially between Social Network Services and Cloud Storage Services is completely different. 

So, I developed PhotoSubmitter library as an abstraction layer for this situation.

The Code
------------------------------------------
PhotoSubmitter supports authentication like,

```objc
[[PhotoSubmitterManager submitterForType:PhotoSubmitterTypeFacebook] login];
```

This code will brings up Safari or Facebook app in your iPhone for authentication. You can receive messages from PhotoSubmitter while authenticating with implementing `PhotoSubmitterAuthenticationDelegate`. 

There are a lot of supported services, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and so on. You can enable submitter with just calling login method.

```objc
[[PhotoSubmitterManager submitterForType:PhotoSubmitterTypeDropbox] login];
[[PhotoSubmitterManager submitterForType:PhotoSubmitterTypeEvernote] login];
```

Once PhotoSubmitter is enabled and authenticated, you can submit photo to the service like this,

```objc
PhotoSubmitterImageEntity *photo = 
    [[PhotoSubmitterImageEntity alloc] initWithData:data];
[PhotoSubmitterManager submitPhoto:photo];
```

This code is creating photo entity and submitting photo to the authenticated services asynchronously. You can receive messages from PhotoSubmitter while submitting photo with implementing `PhotoSubmitterPhotoDelegate`.

Custom URL schema setting is needed for Safari or App authentication. See [Implementing Custom URL Schemes](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/AdvancedAppTricks/AdvancedAppTricks.html)
 and [Launching Your Own Application via a Custom URL Scheme](http://iphonedevelopertips.com/cocoa/launching-your-own-application-via-a-custom-url-scheme.html) for more information.

UINavigationController is needed to present built-in WebView and PasswordView. To provide UINavigationController to the PhotoSubmitter, you may implement `PhotoSubmitterAuthControllerDelegate`'s method `(UINavigationController *) requestNavigationControllerToPresentAuthenticationView` in your client code.
